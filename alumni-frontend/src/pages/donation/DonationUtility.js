            From access to higher education, to broader career possibilities, to
            better resources on campus – your gifts are the gateway to making a
            difference in the lives of our students and the communities we live
            in.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter the size of your gift, every rupee counts because
            collectively, with your classmates, your gift to IIIT Bhopal helps

            The Alumni Donations will primarily be part of the “Endowment
            (Corpus) fund” where a part of the collected fund may be spent on a
            designated category/ head/ activity (out of the four categories
            namely A. Infrastructure, B. Students Support, C. Academics D.
            Others)
          </p>
          <p>
            Gifts from you help to buy books, assist students in presenting
            their award-winning papers at conferences, provide scholarships,
            purchase library resources and provide emergency support to
            struggling students. All of these improve the IIITB student
            experience and create opportunity.

            Sustaining high quality of education and research — with a major
            impact on the society at large — is pivotal in the growth of an
            academic institution. Good groundwork support (buildings, equipment,
            networks, etc,) and high quality human resources (faculty, staff,
            etc.) are critical to a quality institution. IIIT Bhopal Bhopal is a
            unique institution in its structure. We have 7000 approx. alumni of
            the institute in 20 years. This means not just more students, but
            also research across more domains and hence more impact. This
            requires a delicate balance between quality and affordability of
            education which can be achieved largely through philanthropic
            gestures from multiple sources, of which alumni can play a key role.
